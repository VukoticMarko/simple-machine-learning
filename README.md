## Repository Structure

1. **CNN Object Recognition**  
   - Implements a Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition tasks.
   - Demonstrates how to train, validate, and test CNN model on popular CIFAR-10 dataset.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   - Focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
   - Explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.
   - It utilizes various anomaly detection models, including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

3. **Data Compression and PCA**  
   - Illustrates dimensionality reduction techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
   - Examines how reducing feature space can enhance model performance or simplify data visualization.

4. **Flower Classification**  
   - This project focuses on classifying different types of flowers using machine learning techniques
   - We use the well-known Iris dataset to train and evaluate multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Provides an introduction to model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

5. **K-Means Classification**  
   - Applies the K-Means algorithm to classify data into clusters.
   - Showcases unsupervised learning and the concept of centroid-based clustering.

6. **K-Means Clustering of Generated Data**  
   - Demonstrates K-Means on synthetically generated datasets.
   - The dataset consists of points generated from multivariate normal distributions with different means.
   - Useful for understanding how clustering behaves on controlled data distributions.

7. **Prediction of Boardgame Ratings**  
   - Uses linear regression and random forest models to predict board game ratings based on various features.
   - Explores data wrangling, model selection, and performance evaluation.

8. **Reinforcement Learning of Balancing**  
   - Investigates a basic reinforcement learning setup for balance control (e.g., inverted pendulum).
   - Shows how agents learn through trial and error in a simulated environment.

9. **Simple NLP**  
   - Covers basic Natural Language Processing tasks.
   - It includes text classification, sentiment analysis, or tokenization examples.

10. **Texts Spam Detection**  
   - Classifies messages as spam or not spam using NLP techniques.
   - Demonstrates data preprocessing (stop words, tokenization) and machine learning algorithms for text.
